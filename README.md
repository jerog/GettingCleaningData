# Human Activity Using Smartphones Dataset - Generate Tidy Summary

This R project is submitted as a peer-graded assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera). The script 'run_analysis.R' is designed to read a series of summary data files in flat text format under the folder 'raw_data', join them into a single data frame, and output a grouped summary of the combined data containing the mean values of selected variables of interest.

For a description of the data and methodology, see 'CodeBook.md'.
